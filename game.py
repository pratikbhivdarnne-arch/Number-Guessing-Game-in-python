=== Number Guessing Game ===

Choose difficulty:
1) Easy   (1â€“50,  10 attempts)
2) Medium (1â€“100, 7 attempts)
3) Hard   (1â€“200, 6 attempts)
Enter 1, 2, or 3: 2

I picked a number between 1 and 100. You have 7 attempts!
[Attempt 1/7] Your guess: 60
Too high (close)
[Attempt 2/7] Your guess: 47
Too low
[Attempt 3/7] Your guess: 53
ðŸŽ‰ Correct! 53 was the number. You won in 3 attempts.

Play again? (y/n): n
Thanks for playing! ðŸ‘‹
